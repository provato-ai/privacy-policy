* It is very important to include that users can review and change the permissions that they have granted to your application, within their social media account settings.
* **Transparency:** Be very clear about what specific data you are collecting from the social media provider.
* **User Control:** Emphasize that users have control over what information they share through their social media accounts.
* **Security:** Reinforce the security measures you take to protect all user data, including data obtained through social authentication.
* **Social Media Provider Policies:** Remind users that the privacy policies of the social media providers themselves also apply.
